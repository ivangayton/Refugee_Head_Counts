\subsubsection{Rapid Household Count}
Do not visit each structure, just estimate the number of structures to get a rapid estimate of the number of people, without any demographic detail.

Use in case of:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Recent displacement
  \item To estimate the resources needed for blanket distributions
  \item To compare and prioritize needs between several potential interventions
\end{itemize}
Methods
From above
Satellite 
Aircraft (plane or helicopter)
Drone (fixed-wing or multicopter)
Balloon/kite
From the ground
GPS survey to get total area, multiply by structure density and persons/structure
Completion time: 1-3 days

FLOWCHART 1
Rapid Household Survey
Visit each structure, but gather only basic information (number of people disaggregated by age and sex)
Use in case of:
To conduct a basic needs assessment for a given population (i.e. ordering supplies)
To determine the extent and distribution of primary health care needed for patients


Methods

Completion time: 1-2 weeks
FLOWCHART 2
Detailed Household Survey
The estimate the resources needed for either blanket or targetted distributions
